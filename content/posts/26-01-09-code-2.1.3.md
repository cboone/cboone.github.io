From [Claude Code's CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#213) for 2.1.3:

> Merged slash commands and skills, simplifying the mental model with no change in behavior.

This is great news. The division between skills and slash commands was arbitrary and confusing.

Skills now appear as slash commands. For example, I have a `writing-bash-scripts` skill that now is available as `/writing-bash-scripts`. When I run it, it loads the skill into context and is ready to apply it as needed.

Obviously, most of the time it will still be better to let `code` manage the loading of skills itself, as needed. But if you don't want to rely on the auto-loading, you can load it directly.
