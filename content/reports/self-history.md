title: "Self: The invisible language that powers modern computing"
---

Self may be the most influential programming language that most developers have never heard of. Designed in **1986** by **David Ungar** and **Randall B. Smith** at Xerox PARC,  this prototype-based language pioneered nearly every optimization technique used in today's JavaScript engines and Java virtual machines. Though Self never achieved mainstream adoption, its DNA runs through V8, HotSpot, SpiderMonkey, and JavaScript's object model—making it one of computing's most consequential "failures."

The language emerged from frustration with Smalltalk's complexity. Ungar, fresh from his award-winning Berkeley dissertation on Smalltalk performance, joined Smith at PARC to explore a radical simplification: what if object-oriented programming didn't need classes at all?

## From PARC to Stanford to Sun: a research odyssey

Self's journey through three institutions shaped both the language and the engineers who would later transform the industry.  The **design phase at Xerox PARC (1985-1986)** established the conceptual foundations, with Smith bringing insights from his Alternate Reality Kit prototype system and Ungar contributing deep expertise in dynamic language implementation.

When Ungar moved to Stanford as an assistant professor, **implementation began in earnest (1987-1990)**. His graduate students—including **Craig Chambers** and **Urs Hölzle**—built the first working compiler in 1987  and published "Self: The Power of Simplicity" at OOPSLA that year. The paper was later recognized as one of the three most influential OOPSLA papers from 1986-1996. The team publicly released Self in 1990, demonstrating that a prototype-based language could achieve remarkable performance.

The **Sun Microsystems era (1991-1995)** brought additional talent, including **Lars Bak**  and Mario Wolczko. The team developed the Morphic UI framework  and released Version 4.0 in 1995 with a completely redesigned programming environment. But 1995 also marked Java's launch, and Sun redirected resources toward its new commercial priority.  The Self project officially ended that year.

## The technical revolution: eliminating classes, inventing modern JIT

Self's core insight was that classes are unnecessary for object-oriented programming.  Objects inherit directly from other objects through **prototype delegation**—when a message is sent, the system searches the receiver for a matching slot, then recursively searches parent objects.  Creating new objects requires only **cloning** existing ones, not instantiating from abstract class descriptions.

This simplicity created severe performance challenges that drove groundbreaking innovations. The most important was **maps** (now called "hidden classes" in V8): an implementation-level structure that transparently groups objects with identical slot layouts.   Since objects cloned from the same prototype typically share structure, maps enabled class-like optimization without language-level classes. V8's documentation explicitly acknowledges: "This basic idea is not new—the prototype-based programming language Self used maps to do something similar."

**Polymorphic inline caches (PICs)**, introduced by Hölzle, Chambers, and Ungar in 1991, solved the problem of call sites that encounter multiple receiver types. Rather than falling back to slow dictionary lookups, PICs generate stub routines that test receiver types and branch directly to cached methods. This technique achieved **11% median speedup** on typical programs and became standard in all modern JavaScript engines.

The team's work on **adaptive optimization** proved equally transformative. Urs Hölzle's 1994 PhD thesis demonstrated that compilers could use runtime type information collected by PICs to guide aggressive speculative optimization, then safely **deoptimize** when assumptions failed. This approach—compile quickly at first, then recompile hot code with full optimization—became the foundation of Java's HotSpot VM and every major JavaScript engine.

## Why Self remained a research curiosity

Despite its technical brilliance, Self faced formidable adoption barriers. The system required approximately **32MB of RAM**—extraordinary when typical PCs had 8-16MB.   Its image-based development model, where programs existed as "snapshots" of memory rather than source files, confused developers trained in file-based workflows.  The GUI-intensive environment demanded substantial hardware and made text-based development awkward.

More fundamentally, prototype-based programming was simply unfamiliar. Industry and academia had converged on class-based object orientation, and Self's alternative paradigm required conceptual reorientation that few were willing to undertake.  When Sun cancelled the project in favor of Java, Self lost its institutional champion. By the time hardware caught up with Self's requirements, JavaScript and Java had captured mindshare.

The project didn't entirely disappear. Community members released Version 4.4 in 2010 with Linux support, and **Self 2024.1** shipped in August 2024  with FreeBSD and NetBSD support. The codebase remains active on GitHub, maintained by enthusiasts who recognize its historical significance.

## Legacy: powering billions of devices invisibly

Self's influence flows through two channels: language design and virtual machine technology. **Brendan Eich** explicitly adopted Self's prototype model when creating JavaScript in 1995, later writing: "I'm not proud, but I'm happy that I chose Scheme-ish first-class functions and Self-ish prototypes as the main ingredients."   Every JavaScript object's ability to inherit directly from another object descends from Self.

**NewtonScript** (1993) adapted Self for Apple's Newton PDA, demonstrating that prototype-based programming could work on resource-constrained devices.   **Lua**'s metatable mechanism enables Self-style delegation.  **Io**, **Slate**, and numerous research languages carried forward the prototype paradigm.

The VM influence runs even deeper. After Sun cancelled Self, Hölzle and Bak founded Animorphic to build Strongtalk, a high-performance Smalltalk using Self techniques. **Sun acquired Animorphic in 1997**, and the technology became the **Java HotSpot VM** released in 1999.  When Google hired Lars Bak in 2006 to build Chrome's JavaScript engine, he directly transplanted Self's optimizations into **V8**.  Hidden classes, inline caches, adaptive optimization, and deoptimization—the techniques that make JavaScript fast enough to power modern web applications—all originated in Self research.

## Conclusion

Self represents a fascinating paradox: a language that "failed" commercially yet became foundational to modern computing. The techniques Ungar, Smith, Chambers, Hölzle, and Bak developed at PARC, Stanford, and Sun now execute every time JavaScript runs in a browser, Java runs on a server, or any JIT compiler optimizes hot code paths.  Self's vision of "simplicity, uniformity, concreteness, and liveness" lives on  not in Self programs but in the infrastructure that powers billions of devices daily.

The language also demonstrated that radical simplification can drive innovation. By eliminating classes, Self forced its implementers to invent new optimization strategies—strategies that proved more powerful and general than the class-based approaches they replaced. Self's lesson for language designers: constraints can catalyze creativity, and today's research curiosity may become tomorrow's invisible foundation.
