title: "The complete history of agile: from Toyota to transformation"
---

From Toyota's factory floors to today's global software industry, this timeline traces the full evolution of agile methodology—its intellectual roots, key breakthroughs, influential figures, landmark publications, and organizational milestones.

-----

## Pre-History: Manufacturing and Management Foundations (1940s–1960s)

**1940s** — **Taiichi Ohno** begins developing the Toyota Production System (TPS) at Toyota Motor Corporation in Japan, introducing concepts like just-in-time delivery, continuous improvement (kaizen), and respect for workers that will later influence agile thinking.

**1950** — **W. Edwards Deming** teaches statistical quality control to Japanese engineers; his Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle becomes foundational to iterative improvement philosophies.

**1950s** — **Shigeo Shingo** collaborates with Ohno to refine TPS, developing Single-Minute Exchange of Dies (SMED) and poka-yoke (mistake-proofing) techniques.

**1958–early 1960s** — NASA's **Project Mercury** uses half-day time-boxed iterations with test-first development—planning and writing tests before each micro-increment. Gerald Weinberg later recalls this as deliberate incremental development: "We were doing incremental development as early as 1957… All of us, as far as I can remember, thought waterfalling of a huge project was rather stupid."

**1961** — IBM's **Federal Systems Division**, seeded by Mercury personnel, becomes a major proponent of iterative approaches for government and aerospace projects.

-----

## Early Iterative Development (1968–1988)

**1968** — NATO Software Engineering Conference in Garmisch, Germany coins the term "software crisis" to describe chronic project failures. Brian Randell and F.W. Zurcher present early iterative and incremental development (IID) concepts.

**1970** — **Winston Royce** publishes "Managing the Development of Large Software Systems," which describes sequential phases but explicitly warns this approach "is risky and invites failure." Ironically, the paper becomes misread as an endorsement of waterfall. His son Walker later confirmed: "He was always a proponent of iterative, incremental, evolutionary development."

**1972** — IBM's **USS Trident submarine** command-and-control project uses four six-month iterations for over one million lines of life-critical code, driven partly by $100,000/day late penalties.

**1975** — **Victor Basili** and **A.J. Turner** publish "Iterative Enhancement: A Practical Technique for Software Development" in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering.

**1975–1977** — IBM's **Light Airborne Multipurpose System (LAMPS)** helicopter project employs 45 one-month iterations, each delivered on time and under budget.

**1976** — **Tom Gilb** publishes *Software Metrics*, first introducing "evolution" and "evolutionary" terminology to software development processes.

**1983** — The Toyota-GM **NUMMI** joint venture exposes American manufacturers to TPS firsthand, though concepts won't fully enter software vocabulary until later.

**1985** — U.S. Department of Defense issues **DoD-STD-2167**, which essentially mandates waterfall for defense contracts, entrenching sequential development despite mounting evidence of its failures.

**1986** — **Hirotaka Takeuchi** and **Ikujiro Nonaka** publish "The New New Product Development Game" in Harvard Business Review, using the rugby "scrum" metaphor for cross-functional teams moving together. This paper later inspires Jeff Sutherland.

**1986** — **Barry Boehm** publishes the spiral model, introducing risk-driven iteration that combines prototyping with structured phases.

**1986** — **CVS (Concurrent Versions System)** created by Dick Grune, enabling collaborative version control that supports iterative development.

**1987** — The **Defense Science Board Task Force** on Military Software, chaired by Fred Brooks, recommends radical overhaul: "DoD-Std-2167 continues to reinforce exactly the document-driven, specify-then-build approach that lies at the heart of so many DoD software problems."

**1988** — Tom Gilb publishes *Principles of Software Engineering Management*, the first book with substantial chapters dedicated to iterative and incremental development. Both Kent Beck and Jim Highsmith later cite it as influential.

**1988** — Taiichi Ohno's *Toyota Production System: Beyond Large-Scale Production* published in English, bringing TPS concepts to Western audiences.

-----

## The Lightweight Methods Emerge (1989–1999)

**1989** — **Rob Mee** founds **Pivotal Labs** in San Francisco, which will become synonymous with disciplined Extreme Programming practices.

**1990** — **James Womack**, **Daniel Jones**, and **Daniel Roos** publish *The Machine That Changed the World*, coining the term "lean" to describe Toyota's production system and bringing these concepts to mainstream Western management.

**1991** — **Alistair Cockburn** begins developing the **Crystal** family of methodologies while working at IBM Consulting, recognizing that different project sizes require different approaches.

**1991** — **James Martin** publishes *Rapid Application Development*, popularizing RAD approaches that emphasize prototyping and user involvement.

**1993** — **Jeff Sutherland** creates the first **Scrum** implementation at Easel Corporation in Burlington, Massachusetts, working with John Scumniotales and Jeff McKenna. Inspired by Takeuchi and Nonaka's rugby metaphor.

**1993** — **ThoughtWorks** founded in Chicago by Roy Singham, later becoming a leading agile consultancy.

**1993** — The **Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation System (C3)** project initiated to replace multiple legacy COBOL payroll systems with a single Smalltalk/GemStone application intended to eventually serve 87,000 employees.

**1994** — **DSDM (Dynamic Systems Development Method) Consortium** founded in the UK by a group of RAD practitioners including representatives from British Airways, American Express, and Oracle. Introduces MoSCoW prioritization.

**March 25, 1995** — **Ward Cunningham** installs WikiWikiWeb on c2.com, creating the first wiki. The platform enables organic knowledge sharing that spreads XP concepts globally. Cunningham later describes wiki and agile as "two sides of the same coin."

**October 1995** — **Ken Schwaber** and **Jeff Sutherland** present Scrum publicly at **OOPSLA 1995** in Austin, Texas—the first formal introduction of Scrum to the worldwide software community. Fred Brooks declares at the International Conference on Software Engineering: "The waterfall model is wrong!"

**March 1996** — **Kent Beck** joins the struggling C3 project at Chrysler, initially for performance tuning, and becomes project leader. He brings in **Ron Jeffries** as the first XP coach.

**1996** — C3 team formally adopts practices that will define XP: pair programming, test-driven development, continuous integration, refactoring, simple design, collective code ownership, sustainable pace, on-site customer, planning game, and small releases. Reportedly, 75% of the codebase was thrown out during refactoring sessions.

**1997** — **Feature-Driven Development (FDD)** created by **Jeff De Luca** and **Peter Coad** on a 50-person Singapore bank project. David Anderson (later the Kanban pioneer) participates in the original team.

**1997** — C3 first goes live, initially paying approximately 10,000 salaried Chrysler employees.

**1997** — **Kent Beck** and **Erich Gamma** create **JUnit** on a flight to OOPSLA, making test-driven development practical and spawning the xUnit family of testing frameworks. Beck saw it as "a political statement—as a programmer I accept responsibility for the quality of my work."

**1998** — Daimler-Benz acquires Chrysler; the on-site customer at C3 resigns from burnout and cannot be replaced.

**1999** — C3 development stops before expansion beyond the initial population; DaimlerChrysler officially cancels the project in February 2000, but by then XP has spread to many other projects. Martin Fowler noted: "C3's cancellation also proves that XP is no guarantee of success."

**Late 1980s–1990s** — Reviews of U.S. Department of Defense software projects report very high rates of failure and non-use, with only a small fraction of systems deployed without extensive modification and large sums effectively wasted.

**October 1999** — **Kent Beck** publishes *Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change*, defining XP's practices and philosophy. Reviewers call it "dynamite" for changing industry thinking.

**October 1999** — **Dave Thomas** and **Andy Hunt** publish *The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master*, introducing concepts like "tracer bullets" and "broken windows."

**1999** — **Martin Fowler** publishes *Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code*, providing a catalog of 70+ refactorings with step-by-step instructions and making code improvement mainstream.

-----

## The Agile Manifesto and Early Growth (2000–2005)

**June 2000** — **XP2000** conference held in Cagliari, Sardinia—the first major agile conference. Expected to draw 60 attendees, it attracts over 160. Kent Beck, Ron Jeffries, Robert Martin, and Ward Cunningham speak to an audience "thick with current and ex Smalltalkers, now mostly in Java."

**2000** — **Martin Fowler** joins **ThoughtWorks** as Chief Scientist, beginning a partnership that shapes agile consulting globally.

**2000** — **Jim Highsmith** wins the Jolt Award for *Adaptive Software Development: A Collaborative Approach to Managing Complex Systems*.

**September 2000** — **Robert C. Martin** ("Uncle Bob") sends an email seeking to convene "all the lightweight method leaders in one room," initiating the gathering that will produce the Agile Manifesto.

**February 11–13, 2001** — Seventeen software practitioners gather at **The Lodge at Snowbird** ski resort in Utah's Wasatch Mountains. After intense discussion, they produce the **Agile Manifesto**—four values and twelve principles that unify the lightweight methods movement.

**The 17 Signatories:**
- **Extreme Programming**: Kent Beck, Ward Cunningham, Ron Jeffries
- **Scrum**: Ken Schwaber, Jeff Sutherland, Mike Beedle
- **Crystal**: Alistair Cockburn

- **DSDM**: Arie van Bennekum
- **Pragmatic Programming**: Dave Thomas, Andy Hunt
- **Object-Oriented/Patterns**: Robert C. Martin, Martin Fowler, Jon Kern, Steve Mellor, Brian Marick, James Grenning

The morning sessions featured presentations in the Aspen Room; afternoons allowed skiing; evenings continued discussions over dinner. The fiercest debate concerned the name—"lightweight" was universally despised. Cockburn objected: "It somehow sounds like a bunch of skinny, feebleminded lightweight people trying to remember what day it is."

**2001** — The term "agile" adopted after **Mike Beedle** suggests it, inspired by a book on lean manufacturing. Martin Fowler's only concern was that "most Americans didn't know how to pronounce the word." The four values were wordsmithed to **100% unanimity**.

**Late 2005** — Git reaches a 1.0 release, revolutionizing distributed version control.

**2005** — **Hudson** continuous integration server development begins (later forked as Jenkins).

-----

## Scaling, DevOps, and Mainstream Adoption (2006–2014)

**2006–2007** — **David Anderson** develops the full **Kanban Method** at Corbis, reportedly achieving significant improvements in delivery rates and cycle times. His approach drew from Toyota's production Kanban (Japanese for "signboard"), Eli Goldratt's Theory of Constraints, and Don Reinertsen's product development flow principles.

**2007** — **Dean Leffingwell** publishes *Scaling Software Agility: Best Practices for Large Enterprises*, laying theoretical groundwork for SAFe.

**October 2009** — **Patrick Debois** organizes the first **DevOpsDays** in Ghent, Belgium. Needing a Twitter hashtag, he combines "Dev" and "Ops"—the #DevOps hashtag names the movement. Debois later admitted: "There never was a grand plan for DevOps as a word."

**2009** — After philosophical disagreements with the Scrum Alliance, **Ken Schwaber** leaves to found **Scrum.org**, offering competency-based assessments rather than training-based certifications.

**2009** — EMC acquires **Pivotal Labs**.

**2010** — **Jez Humble** and **David Farley** publish *Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation*, winning the Jolt Excellence Award and introducing deployment pipelines.

**2010** — **David Anderson** publishes *Kanban: Successful Evolutionary Change for Your Technology Business*, codifying the Kanban Method. Unlike Scrum's prescribed roles and fixed sprints, Kanban has no mandatory roles and enables continuous flow.

**2010** — First **Scrum Guide** published by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland (following earlier books, papers, and training material describing Scrum), with subsequent updates in 2011, 2013, 2016, 2017, and 2020.

**2010** — Dean Leffingwell publishes *Agile Software Requirements*, further developing scaled agile concepts.

**2016** — Scrum Guide updated to introduce the five **Scrum Values**: commitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect; the 2020 guide later simplified language and added the Product Goal.

**2016** — **Gene Kim**, Jez Humble, Patrick Debois, and John Willis publish *The DevOps Handbook*, providing comprehensive guidance on implementing DevOps practices.

**2018** — **Microsoft acquires GitHub** for $7.5 billion, signaling Git's dominance in software development.

**2018** — **Martin Fowler** delivers influential keynote at Agile Australia identifying the "Agile Industrial Complex" as a key problem—criticizing imposition of processes on teams rather than letting teams choose their own approaches.

**2018** — **Ron Jeffries** publishes provocative article "Developers Should Abandon Agile," criticizing "Dark Scrum" and "Flaccid Scrum" implementations that use agile's name while abandoning its principles: "Dark Scrum is actively using the name 'agile' against the basic principles." The certification industry—what some call "Certified Vanity Plates"—drew particular criticism for prioritizing revenue over genuine capability building.

**2018** — Google acquires **DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment)**, the research organization founded by Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim that established empirical links between technical practices and organizational performance.

## The arc of agile continues to bend

The history of agile methodology illuminates a recurring pattern: practitioners discovering through painful experience that software development resists industrial-era management approaches. From NASA engineers using half-day iterations in 1958 to today's debates about Dark Scrum and post-agile thinking, the core tension persists between treating software development as a manufacturing process versus recognizing it as a learning and communication challenge.

The Agile Manifesto's enduring power lies not in prescribing specific practices but in establishing values that guide adaptation. Kent Beck, Ward Cunningham, and their co-signatories didn't invent iteration or customer collaboration—they synthesized decades of accumulated wisdom into principles that spread virally because they named what experienced practitioners already knew worked.

What began as a ski lodge conversation among 17 people has transformed into a global industry with its own conferences, certifications, and (inevitably) pathologies. Whether mainstream agile preserves or betrays its founders' intentions remains contested. But the underlying insight—that complex, creative work requires different approaches than repetitive production—continues shaping how software gets built, and increasingly, how organizations of all kinds manage uncertainty and change.
