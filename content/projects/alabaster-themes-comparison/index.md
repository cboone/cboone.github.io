A comprehensive catalog of [Alabaster](https://github.com/tonsky/sublime-scheme-alabaster) color themes across 15+ editors, IDEs, terminals, and other tools.

## Background

Alabaster is a minimalist color scheme by [Nikita Prokopov (aka Tonsky)](https://github.com/tonsky) that highlights only four semantic classes: strings (green), constants (purple), comments (red), and global definitions (blue). Everything else --- keywords, control flow, operators --- stays unstyled, because they're self-evident from context.

The philosophy is described in Tonsky's blog post ["A case against syntax highlighting"](https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/).

## Coverage

The catalog spans implementations for:

- **Code editors**: Sublime Text, VS Code, Vim, Neovim, Emacs, Zed, Helix
- **IDEs**: JetBrains (IntelliJ), Android Studio
- **Terminal emulators**: Alacritty, Kitty, iTerm2, Warp, Rio, and [14 more](https://github.com/cboone/alabaster-themes-for-terminals)
- **Other tools**: Zathura, Wofi, Fzf, X resources
