Terminal color themes for Alabaster Dark and Alabaster Light, available for 14 different terminal emulators.

## Background

These terminal themes are inspired by [the Alabaster color scheme](https://github.com/tonsky/sublime-scheme-alabaster) created by [Nikita Prokopov (aka Tonsky)](https://github.com/tonsky) and the philosophy outlined in his blog post ["A case against syntax highlighting"](https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/).

In the original IDE themes, Alabaster highlights only four syntax classes: strings, constants, comments, and global definitions. Terminal themes are limited to 16 ANSI colors, but the same principle applies: use color sparingly and intentionally.
