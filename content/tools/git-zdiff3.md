I've been using `git` since 2007 or so, when the pre-GitHub team started talking it up in [the SF Ruby scene](https://web.archive.org/web/20070216143617/http://sfruby.org/). (Oh man, icanhazRuby. That was a time.)

Sidenote: Recently I found [this amazing interview](https://web.archive.org/web/20070216143357/https://sfruby.org/posts/interview-with-the-san-francisco-rubyists-at-lingr) Chris Wanstrath did with me and [Danny Burkes](https://github.com/dburkes) in early 2007, well before any of us were using `git`. Note the CVS / SVN joke. Also, I retract my statement about Poison; Danny was right, [Def Leppard rules](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSdljm909Y&pp=0gcJCTIBo7VqN5tD).
