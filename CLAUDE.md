# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a GitHub Pages personal site repository (`cboone.github.io`). Currently minimal - contains only an empty README file.

## GitHub Pages

The site is served at `https://cboone.github.io`. Any HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files added to the root or configured directories will be automatically served by GitHub Pages.

To add content:
- Add an `index.html` for the main page
- Optionally use Jekyll for static site generation (GitHub Pages has built-in Jekyll support)
